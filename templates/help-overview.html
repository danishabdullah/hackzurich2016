                The goal of this project is to help you calibrate your confidence levels in probability estimates.
                
                It's not about knowing things about the world, it's about getting a better feeling for what you know about the world and the limits of this knowledge.`

            {
                explanation: `We will ask you Questions that will be hard to answer correctly, e.g.: "How many hairs are on your head?" we want ballpark estimates to these questions and don't expect exact answers (but if you know them, use them!).
                Your answers will consist of a lower and upper bound for your estimate. The values should be chosen in a way that you think it's equally likely that the true answer is within or outside that range.
                So when you have a question like "How many christians live in New York?" and you expect the answer to be ~500k but are relatively uncertain, you could give a lower value of 50k and an upper value of 5000k, about 50% of your answers should be correct.
                Most people who try this for the first time end up with ~2 correct answers...

                Good luck.`
