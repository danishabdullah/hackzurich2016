Bush famously invaded Iraq convinced to find weapons of mass destruction, and believed to pacify the country in a matter of months. But it's not just politicians, it's you too! When polled, 93% of US drivers reported they consider themselves better than average. This game will help you to understand overconfidence &mdash; and even better, to become more rational over time.</p>`

                Most people who try this for the first time end up with ~2 correct answers...</p>
