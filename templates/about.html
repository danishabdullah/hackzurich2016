        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>We need to make judgements every day - for project deadlines, whether he likes us back (or not), how likely it is we will get that job and how hungry we are when ordering food.
        Humans tend to be overconfident in their subjective confidence concerning those estimates. Luckily, we think, it's possible to change that.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to provide a tool to calibrate yourself by answering questions within a confidence interval, then get feedback on how well your confidence models your certainty about a subject. When using our app you will notice that you're getting better in your judgements over time and be able to accurately model your own uncertainty. Our hope is that this generalizes to other domains and will help you make better judgements in other aspects of your life</p>
